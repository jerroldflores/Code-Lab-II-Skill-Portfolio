Exercise 3: PI
Create a program to calculate the circumference and area of a circle from the radius. The program should ask the user to enter the desired radius of the circle.
PI is defined as: 3.14159 Area is defined as: PI * radius * radius Circumference is defined as: PI * Radius * 2.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int angle1, angle2, angle3, sum;

    /* Input all three angles of triangle */
    printf("Enter three angles of triangle: \n");
    scanf("%d%d%d", &angle1, &angle2, &angle3);

    /* Calculate sum of angles */
    sum = angle1 + angle2 + angle3; 

    /*
     * If sum of angles is 180 and
     * angle1, angle2, angle3 is not 0 then
     * triangle is valid.
     */
    if(sum == 180 && angle1 > 0 && angle2 > 0 && angle3 > 0) 
    {
        printf("Triangle is valid.");

int main()
{
	int n;

    cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    cin >> n;

    if ( n % 2 == 0)
        cout << n << " is even.";
    else
        cout << n << " is odd.";

    return 0;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> number;

    while (number >= 0) {
        // add all positive numbers
        sum += number;

        // take input again if the number is positive
        cout << "Enter a number: ";
        cin >> number;

	char choice;
    do { // do everything in the do block while...

        cout <<"Do you want to end the loop now, enter Y or N ?"<< endl;

        cin >> choice;

        if (choice != 'Y' and choice != 'y' and choice != 'N' and choice != 'n') // if needed add input 
            cout << choice << " is not a valid option. Try agian" << endl; // validation

    } while (choice !='N' && choice !='n'); // the user input does not equal 'N'andr 'n'
