Exercise 1: Input Arrays
Write a program that requests five numbers from the user and adds these into an array. Once the values have been inputted display them to the user in a nicely formatted list.
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int numbers[5] = {7, 5, 6, 12, 35};

    cout << "The numbers are: ";

    //  Printing array elements
    // using range based for loop
    for (const int &n : numbers) {
        cout << n << "  ";
    }


    cout << "\nThe numbers are: ";

    //  Printing array elements
    // using traditional for loop
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        cout << numbers[i] << "  ";
    }

    return 0;
}

Exercise 2: The Mad Hatter
The Mad Hatter likes to reverse words. Write a program that allows him to print out any given String in reverse. The user should be able to enter the word and the resulting output should say:
The Mad Hatter Says: word in reverse

Exercise 3: Even Higher
Find and display the value that is the highest even number in an integer array. For testing the array should use the following values:
15, 2, 6, 11, 12, 13, 9

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i, n;
    float arr[100];

    cout << "Enter total number of elements(1 to 100): ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << endl;

    // Store number entered by the user
    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
       cout << "Enter Number " << i + 1 << " : ";
       cin >> arr[i];
    }

    // Loop to store largest number to arr[0]
    for(i = 1;i < n; ++i)
    {
       // Change < to > if you want to find the smallest element
       if(arr[0] < arr[i])
           arr[0] = arr[i];
    }
    cout << "Largest element = " << arr[0];

    return 0;
}


Exercise 4: Standard Library Array Input
Write a program that puts 5 integer values provided by the user into a standard library array. Once the values have been inputted display them to the user is a nicely formatted list.
Exercise 5: Fix the World
I’ve got my letters all jumbled up! Make the below range based for loop output “Hello World” without altering the char array directly.
char letters[] {'I', 'f', 'm', 'm', 'p', '!', 'X', 'p', 's', 'm', 'e'};
for(auto i : letters){
    cout << i;
}



Exercise 6: Max Values
Write a C++ program that will prompt the user to input ten integer values. The program should then determine the smallest and greatest of those values and display these to the console. You should complete this task using basic arrays.
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int n, largest;
   int num[50];
   cout<<"Enter number of elements you want to enter: ";
   cin>>n;

   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cout<<"Enter Element "<<(i+1)<< ": ";
      cin>>num[i];
   }
  
   largest = num[0];
   for(int i = 1;i < n; i++) {
      
      if(largest < num[i])
         largest = num[i];
   } 
   cout<<"Largest element in array is: "<<largest;
   return 0;
}

Exercise 7: 2D Average
Writes a program to find the average value of each column of a 2D array of type double.
Exercise 8: Address Storage
Use a string multidimensional array to store the names and respective postcodes of 3 or more people you know. The data should be inputted by the user. Next have the program print out the details of each person on a new line, e.g.
Exercise 9: Times Tables
Write a program that declares and empty 12 x 12 multidimensional array.
Next make use of a nested for loop to assign the values of the 12 times table into the multidimensional array.
Now use a second nested for loop to output the values in the multidimensional array. You should aim to neatly format the outputted values
Example Output:
1 times table:
---------------

1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
1 x 4 = 4
1 x 5 = 5
1 x 6 = 6
1 x 7 = 7
1 x 8 = 8
1 x 9 = 9
1 x 10 = 10
1 x 11 = 11
1 x 12 = 12

2 times table:
---------------

2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20
2 x 11 = 22
2 x 12 = 24

etc

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int n;      //To take input
    int table[12][3]; // Table
    cout << "Input a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    // Generating Output
    for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++)
{
    table[i][0] = i + 1;
    table[i][1] = n;
    table[i][2] = table[i][0] * table[i][1];
}

    for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++)
{
    cout << table[i][0] << " * " << table[i][1] << " = " << table[i][2]<<endl;
}
    return 0;
}



Exercise 10: Weather Data
Write a program that takes temperature data for the last 7 days for two emirates (e.g. Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah) and stores the data into a 2D array. Once the data is inputted do the following:
Output the data to the console
Display the highest, lowest and average temperature for each emirate.
Display the highest, lowest and average temperature for the emirates combined
You can use either a built in array or a standard library array for this task. If using a standard library array remember the syntax for declaring a 2D array is:
array<array<int,7>, 2> temperatures;
