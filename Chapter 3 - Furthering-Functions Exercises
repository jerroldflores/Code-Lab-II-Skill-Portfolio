Exercise 1: Sum Function
Write a program that calculates the sum of two values. The program should get the two values from user input and output the results to screen.
Exercise 2: Double Trouble
Write a program that uses a function to double the number passed to it.
You should pass the variable by value.
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int num1, num2;
    cout<<"Enter first integer number: ";
    
    cin>>num1;
     
    cout<<"Enter second integer number: ";
    cin>>num2;
    cout<<"Sum of entered numbers is: "<<(num1+num2);
   
    return 0;
}

The program should output the result of the doubled value within the function and the value of the variable passed into the function after calling the function.
Exercise 3: Trouble Doubled
Write a program that uses a function to double the number passed to it.
You should pass the variable by reference.
The program should output the result of the doubled value within the function and the value of the variable passed into the function after calling the function.
Exercise 4: Shape Functions
Code a program to display a menu on the screen that asks if the user wants to
1: Calculate the area of a square,
2: Calculate the area of a circle,
3: Calculate the area of a triangle.  

Each of the 3 functions should ask for the necessary information (e.g. lengths and/or angles and output the answer.
1: Calculate the area of a square.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	 float length, width, area;

  cout << "Calculate the area of a square: ";
  cin >> length >> width ;

  area= length* width;
  cout << "Area = " << area << endl;

  return 0;

2: Calculate the area of a circle.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	 float radius, area;

  cout << "Calculate the area of a circle: ";
  cin >> radius;

  area = 3.14*radius*radius;
  cout << "Area = " << area << endl;

  return 0;
}

3: Calculate the area of a triangle.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	float base, height, area;

  cout << "Calculate the area of a triangle: ";
  cin >> base >> height;

  area = (base * height) / 2;
  cout << "Area = " << area << endl;

  return 0;
}
  

Exercise 5: Calculator
In chapter 1 you made a simple calculator. Modify this exercise to use functions. The program should display the following calculator menu:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Modulus

The program will prompt the user to choose the operation choice (from 1 to 5). Then it asks the user to input values for the calculation. The program outputs the results of the calculation. The program should end by asking if the user would like to perform another calculation or not.
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	char op;
    float num1, num2;

    cout << "Enter operator either + or - or * or /: ";
    cin >> op;

    cout << "Enter two operands: ";
    cin >> num1 >> num2;

    switch(op)
    {
        case '+':
            cout << num1+num2;
            break;

        case '-':
            cout << num1-num2;
            break;

        case '*':
            cout << num1*num2;
            break;

        case '/':
            cout << num1/num2;
            break;

        default:
            // If the operator is other than +, -, * or /, error message is shown
            cout << "Error! operator is not correct";
            break;
    }
    
    return 0;
}


Exercise 6: Give me the Product
Write a program that passes an array as an argument to a function. The function should then calculate the product (values multiplied) of the array values and return this value back to the main program.
Exercise 7: Magic 8 Ball	
Write a magic 8 ball program. You should allow the user to input a question to which the program will provide a cryptic response. E.g:
Q. Shall I go out tonight?
A. Outlook looks good

In your solution you should make use of arrays and functions where appropriate
